Repository Contents
Here's a quick overview of the Python projects featured in this repository:


Project 1: Maze Solver
Project 1 is a Python application that showcases a maze-solving algorithm. 
Using depth-first search, this project demonstrates how to navigate through a maze and find the optimal path from the start to the finish. 
It's an excellent example of algorithmic problem-solving in Python.

Project 2: Data Interpolation and Plotting with Turtle

Project 2 is a Python program that allows users to input data points and plots them using the Turtle graphics library. Users can specify the x and y coordinates for each data point, and the program ensures data validity and order. After plotting the input points, the program can interpolate data between specified years and display the results graphically.

This project demonstrates data input validation, graphical plotting, and interpolation calculations in a user-friendly manner, making it a valuable tool for visualizing and analyzing data.
